# SearchEngine
A search engine prototype using Python and Jupiter Notebooks. All the proccess of cleaning data and searching is done,including: lemmatisation, normalisation
tokenization... Making vectorial relations to know which documents best fit to one query. Added a database of documents (folder documents) and queries (topics.xml).
Union.trel file is used to know which document is actually relevant for each query in order to determine the engine's efficiency.
MotorRecuparionAmpliado_L5 is the same script as MotorRecuperacion_L5 but with a new feature. This feature is name recognition, fow which we use a list of names (female.txt and male_v2.txt).
